      <p>
        Hello! I'm Lubabalo Boqwana, a passionate beginner front-end software
        engineer who recently made the exciting transition from being a
        firefighter to pursuing a career in tech. My journey from fighting fires
        to writing code has equipped me with a unique blend of problem-solving
        skills, adaptability, and a keen eye for detail. I'm enthusiastic about
        creating intuitive and dynamic user experiences through web development.
        With a foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I'm eager to continue
        learning and growing in this field. I'm excited to bring my dedication
        and resilience from my previous career into the world of software
        engineering.

      <p>
        Hello! I'm Lubabalo, a dedicated firefighter with a passion for
        technology and problem-solving. After several rewarding years of serving
